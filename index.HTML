<h1>hangman</h1>


<!-- <div class="boxed"> A word will be choosen for you and you must guess what it is by guessing potential letters in that word.
If you choose a correct letter in that word then that letter will be revealed in its correct place within the word.
If the letter is not in the word then a body part will be added to the hangman.
You cannot guess the same letter twice and if the letter appears in the word twice then so too will your letter.
If the hangman is hanged before you can guess the word then you loose, if you can guess the word before the hangman is hanged then you win!</div> // -->
