hangman:

I want to first be able to read a brief description of how the game works (just incase I don't know how to play hangman).

I then want to be able to press a next button to either skip the instructions and/or continue on to the game.

Via the next button I want to then be brought to the main page and press a start game button to begin the game.

Once the game begins I want to recieve my assigned word via blank underscores in place of the letters of that word (so that I know how many letters the word contains).

I want an alphabet at the bottom of the screen where everytime I choose a letter it is X'd out so that I remember which letters I have already used (I want to not be able to use the same letter twice).

Everytime I guess the correct letter I want that letter to be assigned to the correct underscore within my word.

I want a hangman post in the center of the screen that adds body parts everytime I choose the wrong letter.

I want the game to end if the man is hanged before I guess the word.

I want to win if I guess the word before the man is hanged.

At the end of each game I want to be able to press a play again button to play again with a new word.
