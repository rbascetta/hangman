#MVP:

*I want to be able to press **start game** which will bring me to the main screen of the game.

*I want to then be prompted to begin choosing letters/begin the game.

*I want the letters that I choose to be recorded on the screen so that I can see which letters I have already used (I do not want to be able to use the same letter twice).

*If I guess the correct letter I want it to go in the correct blank space of the given word (if the same letter is in there twice I want both blanks to be filled with that letter).

*If I guess the wrong letter I want a body part to be added to the hangman.

*If I guess the word before the man is hanged I want to win!

*If the man is hanged before I guess the word I want to loose.

*At the end of the game (win or loose) I want to be able to reset the game and play again.



#icebox:

*I want to be able to choose different avatars to hang. 

*I want the reset button to pull a new word out of the array instead of refreshing the page as to reduce the chance of a repeated word.
